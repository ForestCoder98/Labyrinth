List over implemented functionality per requested by the assignment:
1. Added a door to the first level and made it functional, to travel to the second level.
2. Created a third level in the maps code, but did not successfully manage to implement the teleport functionality, so have no way of testing if the door on level 2 goes to the created level 3. in theory, it should work.
3. Tried to make the teleport function work, and added code in the labyrint.mjs, but ended up abandoning this task. Decided to leave it, since it didn't seem to break my game.
4. did not make traveling back into earlier visited rooms to work. Game crashes when im trying to re-enter into level 1 from level 2, and i tried to fix it, but it ended up breaking my game even further. 
5. Made a simple patrol code for the NPCs.
6. Sadly, i did not end up doing the previous assignment were we were supposed to practice making animated splash screens, so abandoned this task as well. Managed to successfully implement 3 out of 6 compulsory codes.

Extra additions:
1. Created stats for the NPCs in the code, but they are useless at the moment since no battle system was implemented.
